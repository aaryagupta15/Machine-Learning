# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains my end-to-end Machine Learning projects. Each project covers various stages of a typical ML workflow, including data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Projects Included:
1. **Customer Churn Prediction** - Logistic Regression model to predict which customers are likely to stop using a product or service.
2. **Bike Rental Demand Forecasting** - Linear Regression model to predict bike rental demand based on historical usage and weather data. (Currently in progress)

## Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- statsmodels API
- SciPy
